# AirBnB Listings & Regulation Impact Analysis

Airbnb is a global online marketplace that connects hosts offering stays with guests seeking accommodations. With the rising popularity of short-term rentals, governments have introduced regulations that significantly impact Airbnb's business model. This project dives into how such regulations affect listings and pricing trends over time.

## 🧠 Key Insights

1. 📈 **Initial Growth Phase:**  
   Number of listings and average prices rose consistently as Airbnb gained popularity.

2. 📉 **Regulatory Uncertainty (2015 Onwards):**  
   Listings decreased due to regulatory uncertainty.  
   Average price increased—possibly due to reduced supply.

3. 🧩 **Post-Regulation Stabilization:**  
   In 2019, listings rose again as the market adjusted to the new rules.  
   Increased supply led to a price drop due to competition.
